### Freshman FAQS

###### What is SPS?

The Society of Physics Students is, in a word, *home* for any and all physics majors at Northeastern. Pure physics? Combined physics? Biomedical or applied physics? Experimentalist, or theorist? This is the organization for you. It's a space for you to relax and unwind, meet your fellow physics friends, and share your triumphs and failures. We meet every Wednesday at 12pm in 206 Egan, and all are welcome to join and revel in our oddly characteristic abundance of pizza.

###### What's the deal with the national organization? Do I need to pay to be a part of SPS?

Our Northeastern chapter of SPS is affiliated with a larger national organization of SPSs at universities all across the world, some of whom we plan to collaborate with throughout the year. The **national organization** SPS is affiliated with the American Institute of Physics, and there are some cool perks to joining that organization as well (you can find out more about it [here]). While joining the national organization does have a yearly due, our local chapter right here at Northeastern **does not**, and you are a member of the society just by being a physics major here (we're pretty loose about that).

###### Should I be a physics major?

While we can't tell you whether or not you should be a physics major, here are some good indicators that physics is right for you:

* You have a deep interest in how the universe works, and a pressing curiosity to find solutions to modern problems in physics.

* You like solving puzzles, and wouldn't mind thinking about a complicated question for years on end. You like being challenged, and don't give up on things easily (Prof. Kriokov will tell you PHYS 2305, Thermodynamics & Statistical Mechanics, is the single most difficult undergraduate class offered at Northeastern)

* You enjoyed intro level physics classes (PHYS 1151/1161) or AP/IB Physics, and wish you could learn more about *why* the equations were true, rather than how to use them - advanced physics classes will only cover derivation more and more rigorously, and dive deep into the question of what the laws of our universe truly are.

* You can see yourself doing this for at least 4 years (but probably 5), and wanting to use the knowledge and skills you learn here for the rest of your life - this is not to mean that your choice in major will define you for as long as you live, but you should at least make sure that you'll be happy with it during your undergraduate years at Northeastern. If not, take the time to find something you really love instead (there's nothing wrong with that!)

On the other hand, here are some good reasons *not* to be a physics major:

* Because you think it sounds hard or impressive - being a physics major shouldn't be about trying to impress someone (be that your parents, a crush, or even yourself). Every subject at Northeastern is "hard" in its own way, and has a depth to it that most people will probably never understand. In addition, every field has open problems in it with applications to the real world, that make real differences in people's lives. Just because Einstein did physics doesn't mean you have to.

* Because you came to Northeastern wanting to do physics, and now you think you have to do it - it couldn't be further from the truth! Your first year at the University should be all about exploring: taking new classes, new subjects that you don't know anything about, talking to people you'd never ordinarily talk to. The frank reality is that all of us come to Northeastern not having any idea what we really like, or where our life is going to go, but each time you expose yourself to something new, you gain a new data point about whether you do or don't like that thing. So gather as much data as you can before you make a decision! You wouldn't want to base the next four years of your life off `n=1` data, would you?

Still unsure? Attend an SPS event and get to know what the major is all about. Or even better, talk to a current physics undergrad, and get to know why they chose their major! More than likely, that will give you the information you need to decide.

###### How do I get a lab position with a professor?

First of all, don't stress if you're reading this as not-a-freshman-anymore, and worrying that it's too late for you to work in a lab on campus. There are plenty of people that take on their first undergraduate positions in their sophomore, middler, and even junior years. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't start looking into it as early as possible of course, but hope is not lost.

The first thing about asking a professor to work in their lab is knowing that professors get a *lot* of those emails. Since there are obviously limited spaces, many of these emails get thrown out without a response. However, by putting in just a *little bit of effort* into making your email more thoughtful and poised than the average, you increase your chances of getting that position dramatically.

When searching for a lab to work in, make sure you choose something that's actually aligned with your interests, not just what sounds the most impressive. The professor you reach out to, and all of your future lab coworkers, will easily be able to tell if the research area is something that you are actually interested or not, just by the way that you talk to them. Now, early on in your physics career, you might not know exactly what field of physics you're actually interested in, and that's OK! There's a *lot* of physics out there to be explored, and never make the mistake of thinking that you know everything there is to know. Go through different professors' lab pages and read the abstracts of as many different reports as you can. See if anything sticks out to you as particularly curious. Even if it doesn't end up being your final fit, that could be a great place to start!

Once you know what approximately what field you want to be in, you can asking around for professors that do research in that area. Use all of your resources for this! You can check online on the physics faculty page (linked below), talk to your advisor, or ask a professor in one of your classes if they know of colleagues working in a certain area. Don't be afraid to go and talk to people! Often, your advisor and professors will exactly the people to connect you with that are looking for undergraduate help in their labs.

Now that you've made a list of professors, it's time to deep dive into their work. Get to know exactly what they study, and do some reading up on their previous works. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) is a great resource for this. Find their five most recent papers and read the abstracts for each of them. Are the topics of study something you would be interested in studying yourself? Pick one of the papers that you found especially interesting and skim it in its entirety. Note down something that you especially liked, and why you liked it. You're now ready to send your email.

When it comes to writing your email, we suggest something similar to this template from [the University of California, Santa Cruz](https://ugr.ue.ucsc.edu/email_examples) (there are other great examples available on that site as well):

<div class="letter">
Subject:  Meeting to discuss undergraduate research opportunities in <b>topic</b>
<br />
Dear Dr. <b>Professor</b>,
<br />
I am a <b>year</b> student at <b>university</b> majoring in <b>major</b>. <b>How you found out about the professor's research</b>. <b>Expression of interest in specific paper or topic</b>. I would appreciate the chance to talk with you about your research in <b>topic of interest</b> and about possible undergraduate opportunities in your lab.
<br />
My  experience in <b>research experience or class</b>, confirmed my intention to develop my research skills and <b>goal</b>. I know you are very busy. We could schedule an appointment or I can drop by your office hours on <b>day and time</b>.
<br />
I have attached my resume and unofficial transcript.  Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide. I look forward to talking to you soon.
<br />
Best,

<b>Name</b>

Boom, it's out there! Now, all that's left is to wait for a response üòÅ

It's important to remember that a lot can still happen from here. For one, you will probably not get a response right away. Professors are busy people, and sometimes emails slip by unnoticed for a while. Don't worry if it takes up to a week for them to respond. When you get your response, if they'd like to meet with you, great! Meet them in person and be sure to sell your dedication, interest, and most importantly, time available. If, however, you get an email back saying that the professor doesn't have space for another person in their lab, or that they don't believe it would be a great fit, don't be discouraged. It's not uncommon to have to email at least 5-10 professors before finding someone that's a good match, in your desired field, and open to taking undergraduates. Just begin the process again looking for someone new, and don't give up.

###### Wow, you give great advice!

Thanks! We've been here for a while, so we'd be remiss to not give back and help out our new young friends. Likewise, you should make it a priority to gather advice from your new upperclassmen friends whenever possible, as whatever it is you're struggling with, they almost certainly have struggled with too. SPS is your home, so feel comfortable here in asking questions and reaching out to people. We hope to see you around!
