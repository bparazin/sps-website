Kevin Mendez,"My coop was split into essentially two halves of different kinds of work. The first was growing 2D materials, mainly MoS2. I grew them through chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Growing pristine single layer samples and characterizing them was my goal during this work. The second half was simulating a fast neutron detector using Monte Carlo N-Particle simulation software (MCNP). It's a command line based software that simulates particle transport, and my job was to design the basic reaction chain that leads to the detection of fast neutrons while implementing an already exiting ion detector."
Samantha Emhardt,"My co-op was at a start up called Sense. The product is a home energy monitoring device and phone app. Once installed in an electricity panel, Sense learns all of the different electronic devices in a home. Once a device is learned, the Sense app will tell you when the device is on/off and how much power it is using. My work involved identifying household devices from the graphs and data Sense collects. So, I would look a a graph depicting a change in voltage and label it as a fridge or dyer, etc. "
Nathan Hollis,"My talk covered the time I spent at Resonetics working in their R&D lab. I talked about the sorts of equipment (primarily lasers) I was using and the applications of each, as well as the multitude of projects (primarily in the medical device industry) I was assigned. Within that scope, there were a number of skills I was required to learn, multiple aspects of industrial R&D which are rarely touched in an academic setting, and technical details of how modern lasers perform. I'll expand on some choice examples of special projects I was a part of, but please note I did sign a Non-Disclosure agreement so I will not be able to speak about specific details of certain projects or other proprietary information."
Victor Zeng,"I presented my research in my old co-op at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. I was headed responsibilities in day-to-day process like data management and analyzing T1-MPRAGE scans for a neuroimaging study (involving psychiatric patients) (PI: Matcheri Keshavan). It was a six month co-op starting at July 2017. Coming into the co-op I had coding skills that I had learned from freshmen year to sophomore year, and furthered them since. I very early on had the opportunity to helm the arterial spin labeling pipeline to analyze brain perfusion in the study. Later on, I obtained responsibilities such as running EEGs for our study as well. I talked briefly about the purpose of our study and the two key MRI modalities that I am experienced with, and offer suggestions on how to strive in academia. "
Matthew Maroun,"In this presentation, I gave an overview of my major project while working as an Acoutsic Engineer at Bose Corporate Headquarters, Consumer Electronics – Applied Research in Framingham, MA. I outlined my integration of the MH Acoustics® Eigenmike (32-microphone spherical array) into the system of Matlab used within Bose quarters and two major tools I developed for the device within the infrastructure. The first tool utilizes linearity of sound waves and spherical harmonic, plane wave decomposition to create a graphical user interface (GUI) visualizing the impact of a recording or audio measurement on a spherical surface, as a function of solid angle, frequency of incident sound, and time. The second tool utilizes least-squares approximation methods given impulse responses to develop finite impulse response (FIR) filters that are used on the Eigenmike to recreate (or approximate) an existing spherical microphone beam geometry created by another device. Finally, I detail some of the social and inter-company aspects of life at Bose, in addition to offering what I took from the co-op experience and how it influenced me. "
