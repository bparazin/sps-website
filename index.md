# About

The Society of Physics Students (SPS) is an organization on campus that focuses primarily on engaging students in physics. The club organizes events like research and co-op talks as well as pumpkin carvings and bowling nights. Students involved are able to interact with other students in the physics department and learn about different physics events happening on campus and throughout Boston. SPS is planning on putting together a few events to engage both the undergraduates and graduate students in the physics department as well as other fun events in the future.
