The Physics GRE The mother of all undergraduate physics tests, the Physics GRE is a mammoth of a beast to conquer. We here at Northeastern SPS thought we would give you a little help sharpening your skills, so that you too, can be a mammoth slayer.

[This website](http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/undergrad/ugs_gre.php) contains problems by sections as well as solutions. It also has posted the 1986, 1992, 1996 and 2001 exams:

The solutions to the 1986, 1992, 1996 and 2001 exams are available [here](http://grephysics.net/ans/all-solutions_list.php)

The 2008 exam is available [here](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/practice_book_physics.pdf) with solutions [here](http://physgre.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/2008.html)

[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Student-Companion-Lowry-Kirkby/dp/1904842682) is extremely helpful for review. It is much, much more useful than any of the ETS books:

A set of FREE Physics GRE Flash Cards is available [here](http://www.phys.cwru.edu/flashCards/) courtesy of Case Western Reserve University. You simply need to e-mail them your name and address.

Lastly, there is an iPhone app. for $9.99 called "Physics Subject Test" that contains hundreds of problems and solutions. In our experience, the best method to study for this test is to start months in advance and solve as many of the previous tests as possible.
