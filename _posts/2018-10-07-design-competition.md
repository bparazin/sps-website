Got an eye for design? Always wondered why our newsletters have question marks at the top? We're looking to our community to come up with a new look for SPS,

#### First of all... prizes!

The winner of the competition will receive:
- $25 gift card to any restaurant on campus of your choice (mmmm… Amelia’s)
- Final t-shirt with your design printed on it
- Endless fame and glory as the designer of our t-shirt/logo

All other submissions will receive:
- a feature on our website

#### Rules

- Competition period runs from October 10, 2018 to November 10, 2018
- Design must include a full logo submitted with their original source files and as a high resolution PDF at approximately 2.62 aspect ratio (recommended 3600x1500 pixels, 300dpi). Small variations to this sizing will be accepted, but we recommend using the template provided unless there’s a good reason not to.
- Your design should be fun, clever, physics-themed, and include our name (“ Northeastern University Society of Physics Students”) or something related (“SPS”, “NU”, etc). Colors are your choice (there are no existing SPS colors) but you can look to Northeastern inspiration if you wish. In general, you can get pretty creative as long as someone would be able to reasonably tell that it represents Northeastern SPS :)
- Final designs should be [submitted to this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfy6hnE1w6JpCcHzopQjYXbRfXcIl-JqJ0yJ6JIYGi8vgDBOA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

#### Tips

- We recommend working with Photoshop or Illustrator, but you are free to use whatever you like as long as your submission fits within the rules.
- Not a physics major? Ask a physics friend for some cute ideas on incorporating physics equations or designs into your work.
- Not a digital designer, but can sketch a cool idea? Email sherazi.n@husky.neu.edu for further guidance.
