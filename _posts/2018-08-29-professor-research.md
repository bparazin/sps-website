First of all, don't stress if you're reading this as not-a-freshman-anymore, and worrying that it's too late for you to work in a lab on campus. There are plenty of people that take on their first undergraduate positions in their sophomore, middler, and even junior years. This doesn't mean that you shouldn't start looking into it as early as possible of course, but hope is not lost.

The first thing about asking a professor to work in their lab is knowing that professors get a *lot* of those emails. Since there are obviously limited spaces, many of these emails get thrown out without a response. However, by putting in just a *little bit of effort* into making your email more thoughtful and poised than the average, you increase your chances of getting that position dramatically.

When searching for a lab to work in, make sure you choose something that's actually aligned with your interests, not just what sounds the most impressive. The professor you reach out to, and all of your future lab coworkers, will easily be able to tell if the research area is something that you are actually interested or not, just by the way that you talk to them. Now, early on in your physics career, you might not know exactly what field of physics you're actually interested in, and that's OK! There's a *lot* of physics out there to be explored, and never make the mistake of thinking that you know everything there is to know. Go through different professors' lab pages and read the abstracts of as many different reports as you can. See if anything sticks out to you as particularly curious. Even if it doesn't end up being your final fit, that could be a great place to start!

Once you know what approximately what field you want to be in, you can asking around for professors that do research in that area. Use all of your resources for this! You can check online on the physics faculty page (linked below), talk to your advisor, or ask a professor in one of your classes if they know of colleagues working in a certain area. Don't be afraid to go and talk to people! Often, your advisor and professors will exactly the people to connect you with that are looking for undergraduate help in their labs.

Now that you've made a list of professors, it's time to deep dive into their work. Get to know exactly what they study, and do some reading up on their previous works. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) is a great resource for this. Find their five most recent papers and read the abstracts for each of them. Are the topics of study something you would be interested in studying yourself? Pick one of the papers that you found especially interesting and skim it in its entirety. Note down something that you especially liked, and why you liked it. You're now ready to send your email.

When it comes to writing your email, we suggest something similar to this template from [the University of California, Santa Cruz](https://ugr.ue.ucsc.edu/email_examples) (there are other great examples available on that site as well):

<div class="letter">

Boom, it's out there! Now, all that's left is to wait for a response üòÅ

It's important to remember that a lot can still happen from here. For one, you will probably not get a response right away. Professors are busy people, and sometimes emails slip by unnoticed for a while. Don't worry if it takes up to a week for them to respond. When you get your response, if they'd like to meet with you, great! Meet them in person and be sure to sell your dedication, interest, and most importantly, time available. If, however, you get an email back saying that the professor doesn't have space for another person in their lab, or that they don't believe it would be a great fit, don't be discouraged. It's not uncommon to have to email at least 5-10 professors before finding someone that's a good match, in your desired field, and open to taking undergraduates. Just begin the process again looking for someone new, and don't give up.
